Experiment 2: Basic Assembly Instructions
Code Files

arm
; Load and store data using LDR and STR
MOV r0, #10      ; load 10 into r0
LDR r1, =data     ; load address of data into r1
STR r0, [r1]      ; store r0 into memory location pointed to by r1

; Basic arithmetic operations using ADD and SUB
MOV r0, #5        ; load 5 into r0
MOV r1, #3        ; load 3 into r1
ADD r2, r0, r1    ; add r0 and r1, store result in r2
SUB r3, r0, r1    ; subtract r1 from r0, store result in r3

data DCD 0          ; define data location


Report
In this experiment, we learned how to use basic assembly instructions to load and store data, as well as perform arithmetic operations.
