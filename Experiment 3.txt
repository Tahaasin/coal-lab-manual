Code Files

arm
; Compare two numbers and output the larger number
MOV r0, #5        ; load 5 into r0
MOV r1, #3        ; load 3 into r1
CMP r0, r1        ; compare r0 and r1
BLE larger         ; if r0 <= r1, branch to larger
MOV r2, r0        ; else, move r0 into r2
B end               ; branch to end
larger
MOV r2, r1        ; move r1 into r2
end
MOV r0, r2        ; move r2 into r0 (output)


Report
In this experiment, we learned how to use conditional execution in ARM assembly.
